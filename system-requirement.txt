System Requirements & Architecture Document

Project: EVMBridgeBoard
Audience: Technical + Non-Technical Stakeholders
Purpose: Explain what is being built, why, and how it fits together

1. Project Overview
1.1 Project Name

EVMBridgeBoard

1.2 Project Description

EVMBridgeBoard is a Cosmos SDK–based EVM blockchain application designed to test, demonstrate, and validate dual-wallet interoperability between MetaMask (EVM) and Keplr (Cosmos) using a single on-chain state.

The system allows users to:

Connect either MetaMask or Keplr

Interact with a Solidity smart contract

Write on-chain messages

Observe identical state and balances across both wallets

Analyze gas usage, transaction flow, and wallet behavior

3. System Components
3.1 Blockchain Layer

Technology: Cosmos SDK + Ethermint (EVM)

Execution Environment: Docker container

Smart Contracts: Solidity

State Storage: EVM-compatible storage

Gas Model: Ethereum-style gas

3.2 Wallet Layer
Wallet	Role
MetaMask	EVM-native wallet
Keplr	Cosmos wallet with EVM signing

Both wallets:

Control the same private key

Represent the same account

Use different address formats (0x… vs cosmos1…)

3.3 Frontend Layer

Web-based UI

Wallet connection

Message submission

State visualization

Logging & diagnostics

4. Functional Requirements
FR-1 Wallet Connection

System SHALL allow users to connect MetaMask

System SHALL allow users to connect Keplr

System SHALL identify which wallet is active

FR-2 Address Representation

System SHALL use EVM address (0x…) as the primary identity

System SHALL display Cosmos address (cosmos1…) as a derived format

FR-3 Message Submission

Users SHALL be able to write a message on-chain

Each submission SHALL increment a global counter

Latest message SHALL be retrievable

FR-4 State Consistency

Messages written via MetaMask SHALL be visible via Keplr

Messages written via Keplr SHALL be visible via MetaMask

FR-5 Gas & Transaction Analysis

System SHALL display gas used per transaction

System SHALL log which wallet signed each transaction

5. Non-Functional Requirements
NFR-1 Reliability

System MUST not fork state between wallets

NFR-2 Transparency

All transactions MUST be logged client-side

NFR-3 Usability

UI MUST clearly show:

Active wallet

Addresses

Last message

Message count

NFR-4 Maintainability

Clear separation between:

Blockchain

Frontend

Contracts

6. Implementation Strategy
Phase 1

Deploy Ethermint blockchain using Docker

Phase 2

Configure wallets

Phase 3

Deploy Solidity MessageBoard contract

Phase 4

Build frontend UI

Phase 5

Logging, validation, and testing

7. System Flow (Simplified)

User opens web app

User connects wallet

Wallet signs EVM transaction

Transaction hits Ethermint

Contract state updates

UI refreshes state

Other wallet sees same state
